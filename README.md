# MODFLOW-2005 + POLYNOMIAL CHAOS EXPANSIONS

## General idea

The attached scripts couple a MODFLOW model with the polynomial chaos expansions for quantifying the propagation of uncertainty in the groundwater flow.

It connects Chaospy (Feinberg, XX) and Flopy (XX). 

## Theory:
Polynomial chaos expansions are quite useful to quantify uncertainty when the parameter space is low-dimensional.
